## What is a hackweek?

The hackweek model has emerged within the data science community as a powerful tool for fostering exchange of ideas in research and computation by providing training in modern data analysis workflows. In contrast to conventional academic conferences or workshops, hackweeks are intensive and interactive, facilitated by three core components: tutorials on state-of-the-art methodology, peer-learning, and on-site project work in a collaborative environment. This setup is particularly powerful for sciences that require not only domain-specific knowledge, but also effective computational workflows to foster rapid exchange of ideas and make discovery, as has been shown by the success of the previous Astro-, Neuro-, and Geohackweeks. This is an excellent match with the nature of oceanographic research where data are large and complex and the community is diverse and collaborative.

### Quick Info
- Oceanhackweek will be held in the [**Odegaard Active Learning Center**](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Odegaard+Undergraduate+Library/@47.6564656,-122.31254,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x549014f329bffff7:0x6efe7422cf2f2f93!8m2!3d47.656462!4d-122.310346)**, Room 136** at the University of Washington, Seattle campus.
- **Doors open at 9:00 am** each morning (Monday-Friday) and we will get started right around 9am. The doors will be locked each morning prior to 9am.
- Check in will take place on the first day. You will receive a nametag and be asked to sign a media release form.
- Due to space limitations, only registered Oceanhackweek participants will be allowed to attend the tutorials and open working sessions.
- **Participants are expected to attend all scheduled Oceanhackweek activities.** Contact an organizer if any circumstances prevent you from attending.

### Food

- Breakfast and lunch are provided for all five days of Oceanhackweek.
- Breakfast will be provided through meal cards, in which you can purchase on campus food at [Local Point](https://hfs.uw.edu/Eat/Dining-Locations/Local-Point) in [Lander Hall](https://www.google.com/maps?ll=47.655878,-122.31524&z=15&t=m&hl=en-US&gl=US&mapclient=embed&cid=14768209898309609299). Local point is an All-You-Care-To-Eat dining facility. Breakfast will be available from 7am - 9am each morning. Feel free to stop by anytime between 7am and 9am to grab breakfast.
- Lunch will be catered and held at the [eScience Institute](https://goo.gl/maps/5H5xF2nFjFU2) each day.
- If you are staying in the dorms, you will receive your meal card for breakfast when you check-in at Lander Hall. If you are not staying at the dorms, you can pick up your meal card at the Lander Hall front desk the morning of August 20th. If you do not pick up your meal card that morning, we will bring them to you at Odegaard and hand them out later that day.
- Dinner and drinks will be provided on Monday at the Welcome Reception held at the [eScience Institute](https://goo.gl/maps/5H5xF2nFjFU2).
- Participants are expected to take care of their own dinners Tuesday - Friday.
- If you plan to drink alcohol at our reception on Monday, please be sure to bring ID as the bartenders are required to check.
- Coffee breaks will be provided each day.

### Internet access and communication!
- For information on wireless access, you can either use Eduroam, if it’s available to you, or we’ll give you guest access to the UW network on the first day.
