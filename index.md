## What is a hackweek?

The hackweek model has emerged within the data science community as a powerful tool for fostering exchange of ideas in research and computation by providing training in modern data analysis workflows. In contrast to conventional academic conferences or workshops, hackweeks are intensive and interactive, facilitated by three core components: tutorials on state-of-the-art methodology, peer-learning, and on-site project work in a collaborative environment. This setup is particularly powerful for sciences that require not only domain-specific knowledge, but also effective computational workflows to foster rapid exchange of ideas and make discovery, as has been shown by the success of the previous Astro-, Neuro-, and Geohackweeks. This is an excellent match with the nature of oceanographic research where data are large and complex and the community is diverse and collaborative.

### Quick Info
- Oceanhackweek will be held in the [**Alder Hall**](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Alder+Hall/@47.6554627,-122.3161919,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x549014f3a8e0b367:0xbb5d4cb93538ce99!8m2!3d47.6554591!4d-122.3140032) rooms 103, 104, 107 and the Commons foyer at the University of Washington, Seattle campus.

- Dinner and drinks will be provided on Monday at the Welcome Reception held at the [eScience Institute](https://goo.gl/maps/5H5xF2nFjFU2).
- Participants are expected to take care of their own dinners Tuesday - Friday. Aside from UW dining locations, there are many restaurants on “The Ave” (University Way), serving foods such as subway sandwiches, teriyaki, tacos, etc. that you are worth exploring.

### Flights and Commuting 

For your flights, the closest airport to our university is the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, which offers a range of connections to the University of Washington Campus.

[The Link light rail](https://www.soundtransit.org/schedules/route/40_100479) is an easy, great way to get to the UW from the airport. It arrives at the airport every 5-15 minutes, and the ride to the UW campus is about 45 minutes. The UW station is just a 15-minute walk from Alder Hall. 

From the arrivals hall at Sea-Tac Airport, follow the signs for Link Light Rail; the station is a short walk from the terminal on the far side of the parking garage. Tickets must be purchased at the station before boarding. The cost is $3.25 and can be paid in cash or with a credit/debit card. Take the train to the last stop (UW). Here are [directions](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Lander+Hall,+Northeast+Campus+Parkway,+Seattle,+WA/u+district+transit+station/@47.6528664,-122.311707,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x549014f3ba07b78b:0xccf338a83d26e753!2m2!1d-122.3152398!2d47.655878!1m5!1m1!1s0x549014eca005d559:0x2a5b4b6f98dddc9c!2m2!1d-122.3037968!2d47.6498399!3e2walking) from the UW link stop to the Lander Hall where many of you will check in to stay at Alder Hall. 
 
Taxi’s and uber/lyft are also available from the airport. Please note that for uber/lyft, you will need to meet the car on the 3rd floor parking lot for pick up.

All funded participants will receive up to $400 for domestic and $800 for international flights and commuting expenses only. Please note that business or first class airfare cannot be reimbursed for any reason. All flights must adhere to outlined guidelines as for federal funds [see “Travel” in article 10](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/gc1/jan17.pdf) and the [Fly America Act](https://www.gsa.gov/policy-regulations/policy/travel-management-policy/fly-america-act). Expenses of Individual flights must be itemized on documented receipts, along with commuting expenses such as bus tickets, shuttle receipts, etc. Please be especially aware of this when using travel expense aggregating websites such as expedia.com as not all of these sorts of websites clearly itemize individual travel expenses. International travelers must additionally provide traveler’s I-94 form which are completed upon entry into the US. 
If you have any questions about travel policies, please email travel@uw.edu 

After making sure that all the above requirements are met, please go ahead and book your flights and hold onto all documentation for claiming your reimbursement after the event. All funded travelers will be put in contact with the travel coordinator to send their documentation to via email after the event has concluded. 

### Lodging 

All funded participants will be staying in a doubles dorm at Alder Hall. They will be assigned at random to another particpant of the same sex. You must email oceanhkw@uw.edu by July 19 if you have any special needs. 

Non-funded participants have the option of being randomly paired with another participant of the same sex in a double dorm for $56.50 per night at Alder Hall. They can also stay in a single dorm at Alder Hall for $96 per night. If you prefer either of these options, you must let us know by emailing oceanhkw@uw.edu by July 19 to be added to the list. 

Other affordable options can be found in the [UW guest housing program](https://washington.irisregistration.com/Register?code=GuestHousing19). 

UW has some [homestay programs](https://www.ielp.uw.edu/housing/homestays/) which may be worth looking into. However, there may be some additional commuting you will have to do depending on where your homestay location is if you decide to go with this option. 

If you prefer to stay at a hotel, here are some in walking distance from our hackweek venue that we recommend:
