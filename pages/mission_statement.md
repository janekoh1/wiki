### Core objectives

The core objective of Oceanhackweek 2019 is to promote effective computational practices for ocean research involving complex observational data and model outputs. Examples include but are not limited to visualizing and analyzing high-resolution ocean GCM simulations from ROMS, MOM, and MITgcm and working with datasets from ARGO, OOI, CCHDO, and IOOS.

### Training and education

We will share knowledge in modern software tools aimed at handling increasingly large and complex oceanographic datasets. Our approach will be to develop templates for best practices in solving common oceanographic data science challenges, built off a set of sample datasets provided during the hackathon. We will learn from leading experts in various fields, and use this knowledge to develop educational content that can be shared across disciplines long after the event. Our training will focus on software tools, but we will also explore challenges in successfully navigating complexity in project management and design.

### Networking and community building

We will connect students, faculty, software developers and others across industry, government and academic settings.
The connections we make during the hackathon will be maintained through an online user community. We hope our activities can foster the growth of an interdisciplinary network for solving Earth science challenges.

### Software development

We will harness our collective talent assembled during the event to rapidly advance the development of software tools.
