### What is a Hack?

A "hack" is a small project that aims to solve a specific problem using computational tools.

Examples of hacks include:
* Build a working demo of a new or modified algorithm
* Outline of a larger project, with some key features scoped
* Visualization of an old dataset in a new manner
* Modify an algorithm and apply it to a new dataset
* Combine two pre-existing pieces of code to perform some new function
* Create a tool to apply to work with existing code, datasets
* Transform code from one language to another to use with other tools
* Update old code to run faster, on new machines, and/or more efficiently
* Extend an existing project with an additional feature
* Simplify code to be more maintainable, aka "paying technical debt"


### Tips for getting started

* Start with ideas that are close to home: your research, a project for your company, something you have always been interested in.
* Potentially choose something that you've been interested but haven't had the time or skills to do before, or something you can continue to work on post OceanHackWeek!
* Hacking is a community activity! It's okay to choose projects that you can't accomplish alone as other people will be there to help you, both at OceanHackWeek and outside of it!
* Start with one simple idea first, and when it is built add complexity afterwards.
* Help your neighbor: you might be the person they need to solve their problem, and vice versa.
* When discussing, pitch your explanation to the least experienced hacker in the group, and you'll end up better understanding what you're trying to do, or need to revise your idea.
* You can mix programming languages as needed in order to get started, although all instruction will be done in Python during the week.


### OceanHackWeek specifics

* Who are you going to hack with? Here's [a list of your fellow hackers](participants_2019)
* What are you going to work on? [Project guidelines and ideas](project_guidelines)
* Start pitching ideas on our [#projects slack](https://oceanhackweek2019.slack.com) channel, and then once projects materialize, we can migrate to a separate project channel
* Begin populating an Oceanhackweek GitHub project page - instructions coming soon
