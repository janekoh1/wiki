Here we outline what you would need to complete before arriving to Oceanhackweek. The purpose is to learn about the minimum system requirement for the Oceanhackweek, install the necessary software used during the week, and hopefully answer any other technical question about your computer setup. Our goal is to have everyone up-and-running prior to the event so we can focus our time more productively when you arrive in person.
