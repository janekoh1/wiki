## Project template
Each project requires a brief project summary in the README.md of each GitHub project folder. Below is a template for the project summary.

### Project Title

Brief title describing the proposed work.

### Collaborators on this project

List all participants on the project.

### The problem

What oceanographic data science problem are you going to explore? Try to focus on the data science/methodology problem first, followed by the location-specific oceanographic example afterwards. The project is likely more engaging for fellow hackers if it is centered around common data science problems. For example, the project could be to develop a workflow in Python to analyze CTD time series from multiple data sources, instead of emphasizing and focusing only on temperature variations in one very specific part of the ocean.

### Application Example

Here is where you follow up with a location-specific example of where the data science methodology applies and list example datasets (size, format, how to access) that could be used for this exploration.

### Specific Tasks

List the specific tasks you want to accomplish.

### Existing methods

How would you or others traditionally try to address this problem?

### Proposed methods/tools

Building from what you learn at Oceanhackweek, what new approaches would you like to try to implement?

### Background reading

Optional: links to manuscripts or technical documents for more in-depth analysis.


## Project Ideas
* Developing tutorials for using NASA data on the cloud.
* Working on an efficient open source matchup tutorial for satellite orbital data and in situ point or trajectory data.
* Developing an OSS algorithm development toolbox in Python to deal with a 400GB AMSR brightness temperature - in situ matchup database.
* [Argovis - a visualualization and API for accessing Argo data](https://argovis.colorado.edu/ng/home)
* [OHW18 Projects](https://oceanhackweek.github.io/projects.html)
